## Destructing Array

In JavaScript, destructuring is a feature that allows you to extract data from arrays or objects into distinct variables. It provides a concise way to extract properties or values from arrays and objects into separate variables by using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let [a, b, c] = arr;

```
